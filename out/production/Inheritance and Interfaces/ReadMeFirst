This exercise is more of an explanation than an exercise when it comes to Interfaces. Because we do not create any
Interfaces in any of our assignments it's not as important that you fully understand how to create an interface, but
more what's happening with an interface and how they can help you.

This Item class should look familiar. It's the same one from the Classes and Objects exercises.
Our Shop has come over as well. As the game designers we've decided to move past the basic Item, and make things a bit
more complicated. We're going to add some child classes to handle some different types of items.
In this case we're going to add Food, Potion, Weapon, and Tool (these classes have already been created, but are empty.)

Our Food class will need to increase our characters Health a set amount based on some value assigned to a property
Our Potion class will increase our characters Mana a set amount based on some value assigned to a property.
