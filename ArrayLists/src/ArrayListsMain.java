              To go on our adventure we have gold, a flint, a rope, a healing potion, a dagger, a bedroll,
              a loaf of bread, and a tin whistle.
              1. Create an ArrayList called "inventory" that contains each of these items
    Hint 1:
              2. Log the contents of your inventory displaying the items.

        /* As your adventure goes on your party reaches a shop. Now is a good time to restock.
           Your inventory can hold 10 items.
        The shop currently has:
        Loaf of Bread
        Ham Hock
        Long Sword
        Short Bow
        Healing Potion
        Backpack  <- allows you to carry 10 more items
        Small Silver Key

         3. Choose some items to buy and add those items to your inventory.
            - If you purchase more of an item you already have it will take an additional slot in your inventory.
    Hint 3:
            - remember your inventory can only hold 10 items so if you buy the backpack you can add items there.
    Hint 4:
         4. Log the contents of your inventory (and backpack if you have one)
    Hint 5:
         5. Display a Count of the number of items in your inventory(& backpack).
    Hint 6:
            Your party mates HATE your tin whistle, lets just say you're not the greatest musician in the world, ok.
            The shop keeper will buy it from you.
         6. Remove the Tin Whistle from your inventory.
