Hint 1:
You'll need to declare a new HashMap with the variable name "inventory" that is capable of containing a set of String types as the keys
and Integer types as the values.

Hint 2:
You'll need a for-each loop to do this. Be sure to look at 3.6 to see an example of the syntax for this.

Hint 3:
You'll need to replace the value assigned to the key of "Gold". This method isn't included in the reading, but if you
type "inventory.re" you'll see a couple of "replace" methods. One that requires the old value to be entered, and one
that only requires the new value to be passed. I recommend using the second one.

Hint 4:
If you need to update the value assigned to a particular item in your inventory you'll use the replace method like above.

Hint 5:
You'll need another for-each loop for the backpack if you have one.

Hint 6:
You can use concatenation to make a nice looking output to display the size of your HashMaps.

Hint 7:
Again a method that's not mentioned in the reading, but the "inventory.re" will show you a method you can use to remove
this method from your inventory. Don't forget to update your gold count.

Hint 8:
This is a great place for an If statement to handle searching your inventory (and backpack if you have one) to see if it
contains the "Small Silver Key" and will happen if you don't meet her requirements.
